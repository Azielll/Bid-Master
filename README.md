This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# Installation

If you are retrieving from gitlab, then you need to `npm install` first to get all dependencies.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Note Next week Code Coverage and testing

I might need to make some adjustments to this repository, and if so I will discuss next week
